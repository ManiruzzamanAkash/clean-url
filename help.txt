Hei everyone,
This is a simple clean url maker for any site, Like someone try to make url not using
      <a href="post.php?id=1">View More</a>
This is a weierd something...
Because for that my url will not be SEO friendly.
Cause the url will be --> 
    http://site.com/post.php?id=1
So, I make a simple solution. Just read every code and document carefully and every document is fully commmented perfectly.

And finally we create a url like
    http://site.com/1/this-is-our-first-post
    
Which is a clean and SEO friendly URL

We use .htaccess and make something more by it..

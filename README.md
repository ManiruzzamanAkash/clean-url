# clean-url
Make a clean url for webpage by .htaccess and php
--------------------------------------------------------
Hei everyone,
Clean URLs are prettier, easier to remember, more compact, are easier to link to and allow search engines to spider your site.
Notice how much nicer the last one looks. Clean URLs are great for 6 reasons:

They look prettier
They are easier to remember
They help you save filespace on pages which have many links
They are easier to link to, both for you and for other webbies
They help cut down on typos because there is less confusion about what exactly to write and type
--------------
This is a simple clean url maker for any site, Like someone try to make url not using
      # <a href="post.php?id=1">View More</a>
This is a weierd something...
Because for that my url will not be SEO friendly.
Cause the url will be --> 
    # http://site.com/post.php?id=1
So, I make a simple solution. Just read every code and document carefully and every document is fully commmented perfectly.

And finally we create a url like
    # http://site.com/1/this-is-our-first-post
    
Which is a clean and SEO friendly URL

I use .htaccess from apache mod rewrite and php...
I also make something more by it..
